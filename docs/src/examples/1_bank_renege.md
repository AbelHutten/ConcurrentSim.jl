# Bank Renege

Covers:

- Resources
- Event operators

A counter with a random service time and customers who renege.

This example models a bank counter and customers arriving at random times. Each customer has a certain patience. It waits to get to the counter until sheâ€™s at the end of her tether. If she gets to the counter, she uses it for a while.

New customers are created by the source process every few time steps.
