# SimJulia

a combined continuous time / discrete event process oriented simulation framework written in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) inspired by the Simula library [DISCO](http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/DISCO/), the Python library [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/) and the standalone [QSS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qssengine/) solver.
