SimJulia in 10 Minutes
======================

In this chapter, you’ll learn the basics of SimJulia in just a few minutes. Afterwards, you will be able to implement a simple simulation using SimJulia and you’ll be able to make an educated decision if SimJulia is what you need. Some hints are also given on how to proceed to implement more complex simulations.
