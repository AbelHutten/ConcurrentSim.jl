Installation
------------

SimJulia is implemented in pure Julia and has no dependencies. SimJulia runs on Julia v0.3  and Julia v0.4.

.. note::
   Julia can be run from the browser without setup: `JuliaBox <https://www.juliabox.org/>`_

The built-in package manager of Julia is used to install SimJulia::

  julia> Pkg.add("SimJulia")

You can now optionally run SimJuliaâ€™s tests to see if everything is working fine::

  julia> Pkg.test("SimJulia")
  ...
  INFO: SimJulia tests passed
