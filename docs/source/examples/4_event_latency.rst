Event Latency
-------------

Covers:

  Resources: Store

Scenario:

  This example shows how to separate the time delay of events between processes from the processes themselves.

When Useful:

  When modeling physical things such as cables, RF propagation, etc. it better encapsulation to keep this propagation mechanism outside of the sending and receiving processes.

Can also be used to interconnect processes sending messages.

.. code-block:: julia

  using SimJulia

  const SIM_DURATION = 100.0

  type Cable
    env :: Environment
    delay :: Float64
    store :: Store{ASCIIString}
    function Cable(env::Environment, delay::Float64)
      cable = new()
      cable.env = env
      cable.delay = delay
      cable.store = Store{ASCIIString}(env)
      return cable
    end
  end

  function latency(env::Environment, cable::Cable, value::ASCIIString)
    yield(Timeout(env, cable.delay))
    yield(Put(cable.store, value))
  end

  function put(cable::Cable, value::ASCIIString)
    Process(cable.env, latency, cable, value)
  end

  function get(cable::Cable)
    return yield(Get(cable.store))
  end

  function sender(env::Environment, cable::Cable)
    while true
      yield(Timeout(env, 5.0))
      put(cable, "Sender send this at $(now(env))")
    end
  end

  function receiver(env::Environment, cable::Cable)
    while true
      msg = get(cable)
      println("Received this at $(now(env)) while $msg")
    end
  end

  println("Event latency")
  env = Environment()

  cable = Cable(env, 10.0)
  Process(env, sender, cable)
  Process(env, receiver, cable)

  run(env, SIM_DURATION)
