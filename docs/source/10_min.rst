SimJulia in 10 Minutes
======================

In this section, you’ll learn the basics of SimJulia in just a few minutes. Afterwards, you will be able to implement a simple simulation using SimPy and you’ll be able to make an educated decision if SimJulia is what you need. We’ll also give you some hints on how to proceed to implement more complex simulations.
