    "text": "SimJulia is a discrete-event process-oriented simulation framework written in Julia inspired by the Python library SimPy. Its preferred process dispatcher is based on semi-coroutines scheduling as implemented in ResumableFunctions. A Process in SimJulia is defined by a @resumable function yielding Events. SimJulia also provides three types of shared resources to model limited capacity congestion points: Resources, Containers and Stores. The API is modeled after the SimPy API but using some specific Julia semantics."
